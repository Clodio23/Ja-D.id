                  <p>In short, a virtual private server is ideal for users looking for more control over their hosting environment. Maybe your site traffic has grown, or maybe you have multiple websites and need more resources to run them all effectively. A VPS gives you more flexibility and control to bump up things like RAM and disk space without paying for more than you need.</p>
